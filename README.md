Advanced Custom Fields - Date and Time Picker add-on

This is an add-on for the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) WordPress plugin that allows you to add a Date and Time Picker field type.

This plugin is now obsolete and doesn't work with version 4 of Advanced Custom Fields. Per Søderlind has converted his code to a plugin and uploaded it to the WordPress Plugins Directory. It can be download at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/acf-field-date-time-picker/
